# Neural-Net
A neural network, built entirely from scratch in java. Trains very slowly, due to the also self made, very inefficient matrix class, but achieves up to 95% accuracy on test cases. By default, loads and trains on the MNIST handwritten digits database, and is equipped with a window for you to draw your own digits for the program to guess. Implemented in Processing.
